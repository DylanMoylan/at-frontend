<p>Question 1</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> A 4-year-old boy presents with a painful swelling in his lateral neck. He has a history of surgery to correct a mild great toe deformation, performed at the age of 2, but nothing else of note. The swelling has been bothersome for a week, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have not been helpful. Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (FOP) </p>

<p>&#8226;	Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis</p>

<p>&#8226;	Fibrous dysplasia</p>

<p>&#8226;	Soft tissue sarcoma</p>

<p>Answer explanation: </p>

<p>The main sings of FOP are malformed big toes, swellings, and bone formation in muscle, ligaments, and connective tissue. Patients with fibrous dysplasia do not have malformed great toes and do not have tumor-like swellings.&#160;These signs will need to refer the patients for molecular screening.</p>

<p>Question 2</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Which of the following is a key consequence of a late FOP diagnosis?<u>&#160;</u>&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Psychological burden for the patient and family</p>

<p>&#8226;	Death at a median age of 20 years old</p>

<p>&#8226;	Proximal limb soft-tissue swellings starting at a median age of 10 years old</p>

<p>&#8226;	Great toe deformation starting in the teenage years</p>

<p>Answer explanation: </p>

<p>The FOP diagnostic journey can take a great psychological toll on patients and families, leaving patients with unexplained swellings that often can interpreted as potential malignancies due to inconclusive (and harmful) biopsies.  Great toe deformation is congenital in 95% of cases and is seen from birth; and soft-tissue swellings often start in the first decade of life usually on the back or shoulder. Death usually occurs in the fourth decade of life.   </p>

<p>Question 3</p>

<p><strong>Question type:</strong> Pre/Post Assessment Question Pairs (LLA)</p>

<p><strong>Question Introduction (</strong><strong>optional &#953;):</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Which of the following is a possible adverse outcome after a biopsy in a patient with FOP?&#160;&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Hemorrhage</p>

<p>&#8226;	Malignancy</p>

<p>&#8226;	Flare-up and heterotopic ossification</p>

<p>&#8226;	Cutaneous alteration</p>

<p>Answer explanation: </p>

<p>Biopsy of the commonly presenting soft-tissue swellings during the diagnostic journey to identify FOP can result in flare-ups and heterotopic ossification, but are not associated with a significant increased rate of hemorrhage, malignancy, or cutaneous alterations. Early diagnosis avoids biopsy and associated harm, as well as uncertainty about malignancy.</p>

<p>Genevi&egrave;ve Baujat, MD:	Thank you for your participation to this educational program on fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). It&#8217;s my pleasure to introduce the professor Oliver Semler working in Cologne, Germany. I'm Genevieve Baujat, physician working in the Center of Reference for Skeletal Dysplasia in Paris, France.</p>

<p>	The first question is what is FOP?  </p>

<p>	FOP is a rare, severely disabling, and life-threatening disease. It&#8217;s characterized by the association of congenital malformed big toes, hallux valgus, and recurrent episodes of painful soft tissue swelling called flare-up leading to progressive heterotopic ossification in muscles, ligaments and then deformities ankylosis, with a median age at death between 42 and 45 years. As you can see on this slide, the congenital abnormal big toes are a really valuable tool from characteristic short and deformed on the left of the slide to quasi normal aspects of this hallux. What is important, in any suspicion of hallux valgus, is, first, to perform x-rays showing, as you can see this abnormal first metatarsal and the first phalanges of the toe, which have an abnormal shape, triangular, short, deformed, as you can see on these pictures. So first, to illustrate the importance of early recognition of this severe condition, Oliver will present the first case.</p>

<p>Joerg Semler, MD:	Yes. Welcome from my side as well. I have the pleasure to introduce you to Emilia. She was a 12-year-old girl when she came to our hospital for the first time. She presented in the medical history with a normal pregnancy and birth without any abnormalities and the first medical problem occurred at the age of around 2 years, when she had a swelling in the neck, which was documented for some months without a clear diagnosis. Then somebody decided, well, it&#8217;s probably a calcified hematoma after a bite of an insect without any further investigation. During the following years, another swelling at the front of the thorax was seen in the area of the clavicula and they made the diagnosis of non-bacterial osteomyelitis and she was treated with nonsteroidals for some weeks without any really beneficial effect.</p>

<p>	The other medical problem that the girl had during childhood was that she always presented with a bit of a strange gait pattern, and she presented to the orthopedic doctor a few times and the physicians diagnosed hallux valgus and said that this was the reason for the unusual walking pattern. Everything else was normal, without other chronic diseases or severe health issues during her childhood. She received normal vaccination according to the recommendations in the country. She presented with a normal height and the height was in the upper normal range which was okay for her tall parents. However, as you can see around the age of 9 or 10 years, the measurements of her height became somehow difficult, and the height curve varied more than it should be. If you look at these data after few years and after knowing the diagnosis, you can see that there might already be some difficulties with standing and measuring height properly.</p>

<p>	At the age of 10, severe and big swelling of the lateral neck occurred which was not responsive to anything. At that time, biopsy was taken and nothing specific turned out and it was recommended to do MRI to look for other findings and also to look if the swelling was malignant. Before this MRI was taken, she had an accident during sport activities and for that reason, for the first time an x-ray was taken of the neck and the lung and this also showed some calcifications in the muscles and some heterotopic ossification, that led the way to the correct diagnosis of FOP which, finally, was confirmed by genetic testing. So, all together, the combination of the swelling, the calcifications in the muscles and the toe deformities are clear and typical signs for FOP. All these symptoms presented already at the age of 2 years, and if you think about this case and think what would have been the benefit of an early diagnosis and you can see that many flare- ups could have been avoided which were caused by intramuscular injections due to vaccinations.</p>

<p>	The whole burden of a malignant bone tumor which was discussed regarding the swelling at the lateral neck could have been avoided and early start of the treatment with steroids during a flare-up might have caused a reduction of the heterotopic ossifications. Of course, the correct diagnosis of this very rare disease could have improved the treatment in a multidisciplinary team and could have avoided a lot of problems for the patient and the family. I think this is a good example to see what&#8217;s the benefit of early diagnosis. Now, I think Genevi&egrave;ve will present her case. </p>

<p>Dr Baujat :	So, this is the case of Vincent, a young boy referred at the age of 13 years, for suspicion of multiple osteochondroma, multiple exostoses. As you can see on the x-ray, he had this very seen and small exostoses on the proximal tibia and maybe another beginning on the distal femora.</p>

<p>	He was doing well. He had no joint limitation at this age and the familial history was negative. As a particular medical history for himself, he was born with a big toe deformity, quite moderate and he had surgery of the toes bilateral at the age of 2 years, without any complication, especially without any flare-up episode after the surgery. As you can see on the slide, the x-rays showed mild deformity of the big toe with not a short hallux but deformity in valgus. After surgery, he had very nice toes but on the x-rays, we had this particular shape and abnormal first metatarsal and first phalange.</p>

<p>	So, he also has a moderate short first finger but it was not obvious by clinical examination. It was only after x-rays that we also noticed the first short metacarpal bone, and this is also a subtype but important symptom of FOP. Then, because of hallux valgus and the quite shorter first terms, we performed the cervical neck x-rays showing the narrow shape of the cervical vertebra without obvious fusion.</p>

<p>	On the next slide, we have also in his medical history, the notion of hip chondrocalcinosis diagnosed at 8 years without complication and without real joint ankylosis due to this episode. But when we evoked the diagnosis of FOP at 13 years, the x-rays showed punctiform ossification aspect on this hip. So due to all these arguments, we suspected late onset FOP. After explanation, we performed the molecular screening confirming the classic mutation R206H of ACVR1 and judging this was so confirmed and leading to complete assessment of the boy and the support with regular follow-up, prevention measures and regular physiotherapy. We saw him quite recently at the age of 18, he had only a few episodes of joint limitation without real flare-up episodes. The only important last fact was masticatory muscle ossification leading to a degree of trismus. This is also a known complication of FOP.</p>

<p>	On the other slide, we have the last assessment of legs with abnormal ossification in his left hip, but also more exostoses around the knees. This disorder is a progressive disorder with various symptoms depending on the age, severity and the cause of the disease and the recognition of this condition is valuable. It might be as it was a history of hallux valgus or first flare-up or the association between these scalp nodules, the flare-up, but sometimes with normal aspect of the feet. </p>

<p>	So, what is important in FOP diagnosis is of course as it was said by Oliver is to do an early diagnosis to know what the recognizable symptoms are. If you think to this disorder, even if it is complicated, not always easy to discuss this severe condition with the parents, and with the patient. It is important to consider it and to go further to the molecular screening, which is nowadays easy to perform, to be sure not to miss it.</p>

<p>Dr Semler:	</p>

<p>	Thank you Genevi&egrave;ve for this very interesting case. Thanks for pointing out that the genetic testing is important in this disease and nowadays more or less easy to perform. What would be the two or three highlights or signals when should a pediatrician or a local GP think about FOP and go for the genetic testing? What would be the most important symptoms?</p>

<p>Dr Baujat:	Yes. In summary, first at birth and sometimes in countries where there is pre-natal screening, but then it leads to some issues also with the ethic discussions about hallux valgus. All abnormal hallux at birth have to be considered as FOP before something else. Second, the nodules of the scalps, sometimes it is said all these will disappear, it said it was bite by insects as you illustrated, but it is finally a quite frequent symptom in this disorder about half of the patients afterwards present this symptom. Second, these swelling zone, classically in upper back at the beginning and then with progression with lower back. Third, abnormal exostoses. When you have abnormal exostoses, it is also important to think on FOP and also patients present without any clear flare-up but only progressive joint limitation. All these symptoms have to be considered as possible FOP and lead to the molecular screening after, of course, prudent and cautious explanation.</p>

<p>Dr Semler:	Genevi&egrave;ve, thank you very much.</p>

<p>	For summary, I certainly agree that the early diagnosis is important not only regarding the physical development of the patient and the treatment we can offer to the family earlier and treat the flare-ups with steroids at the moment, and in the future, hopefully, with better medication, but I think the early diagnosis is also important from the psychological point of view, that the family know what the disease is, why their children suffer so much, and even if it's difficult to discuss such a diagnosis with families, I think it&#8217;s really important to make the diagnosis as early as possible to have the chance to lead the family into the right direction regarding treatment, patient organization and also regarding psychological health, which is also needed in those families with rare or ultra-rare condition.</p>

<p>	Thank you very much to all the colleagues who participated in this educational program. Please remember to complete the post-activity questions and we wish you a nice day. </p>
