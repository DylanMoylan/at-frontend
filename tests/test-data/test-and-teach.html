<p><a name="_Hlk63401939"></a>Mary Alice<strong> </strong>is a 72-year-old woman<strong> </strong>admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19. She was symptomatic with shortness of breath and fever (temperature up to 38.5&#176;C) for 7 days prior to her hospitalization. She&#8217;s currently on heated high-flow oxygen and the decision has been made to intubate. &#8220;She&#8217;s never been sick a day in her life,&#8221; her son tells you. &#8220;Now, she can&#8217;t even catch her breath. It&#8217;s unbearable to watch.&#8221; Her comprehensive medical history and laboratory tests are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> According to clinical practice guidelines/guidance statements, would you use D-dimer to select the anticoagulant dose for thromboprophylaxis of this patient?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	No</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk63402076"></a>&#8226;	Yes</p>

<p>&#8226;	Need more information</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong><a name="_Hlk63402130"></a>At the time of publication, none of the guidelines or guidance statements for COVID-19 and thromboembolic disease recommend using D-dimer (or other biomarkers) to guide inpatient dose selection for anticoagulation management. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>Hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 infection leads to thromboembolic complications and organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.<sup>[</sup><a name="_Hlk63855583"></a><sup>1,2]</sup> In response, major medical societies have acted quickly based upon the available evidence to provide guidance on prevention of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Major societal guidelines/guidance statements focused on anticoagulation in critically ill hospitalized patients include:</p>

<p><a name="_Hlk66826532"></a>&#8226;	American College of Cardiology (ACC)<sup>[3] </sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)<sup>[4]</sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	American Society of Hematology (ASH)<sup>[5,6]</sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	Anticoagulation Forum (ACF)<sup>[7] </sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<sup>[8] </sup></p>

<p>&#8226;	Scientific and Standardization Committee of ISTH (SCC-ISTH)<sup>[10]</sup></p>

<p>D-dimer is a marker of fibrin breakdown and intravascular clot burden frequently measured at higher than normal levels in COVID-19 patients.<sup>[11,12]</sup> Currently, none of the societal guidelines/guidance statements recommend routine monitoring of D-dimer (or other biomarkers) as a means to guide the intensity of anticoagulation management while a patient is hospitalized.<sup>[3-10]</sup> (Table 2.) However, all patients hospitalized in the ICU for COVID-19 <em>should</em> receive heparin or low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis unless there are contraindications.<sup>[3-10] </sup></p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>&#160;A&#160;72-year-old&#160;woman&#160;presents to the hospital after experiencing a week of progressively worsening symptoms compatible with&#160;COVID-19. She has no known comorbidities. A nasal swab is positive for&#160;SARS-CoV-2. She is&#160;admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)&#160;with&#160;acute respiratory distress syndrome&#160;and intubated.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Which of the following doses of low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) would be most appropriate for thromboprophylaxis in this patient?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Standard</p>

<p>&#8226;	Intermediate</p>

<p>&#8226;	Therapeutic</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong><a name="_Hlk66919393"></a>All patients hospitalized in the ICU for COVID-19 should receive anticoagulation thromboprophylaxis unless there are contraindications. For critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, standard-dose thromboprophylaxis is recommended by most guidelines and guidance statements.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion  </strong></p>

<p>Reported rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are more than 3 times higher than those of non-COVID-19 patients, and rates of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are 10 times as high.<sup>[14]</sup> <em>(NOTE: frequent or routine lower extremity ultrasound screening of COVID-19 patients may contribute to elevated rates.)</em> In a US registry of COVID-19 patients, thrombotic complications occurred in 35% of 170 hospitalized critically ill patients, defined as those requiring ICU care.<sup>[15]</sup> Standard-dose LMWH is generally guideline-preferred over unfractionated heparin (UFH) as thromboprophylaxis for critically-ill patients, in part because of fewer administrations and less nursing exposure.<sup>[3,4,6-10] </sup>(Table 3.) UFH can be used if kidney function is severely impaired. </p>

<p>Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were randomized to receive therapeutic dose LMWH/UFH or usual care based on local practice. Usual care included typical prophylactic dose LMWH/UFH or adjusted dose LMWH/UFH, based on weight and other factors. <em>(NOTE: some adjusted doses were consistent with &#8220;intermediate&#8217; dosing.)</em> The primary composite outcome was the number of days free from the need for organ support (ie, high-flow nasal oxygen, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, ECMO support) or death through day 21 of follow-up.<sup>[16] </sup>At the time of writing, a peer-reviewed publication is pending; however, preliminary, interim, non-adjudicated results of approximately 80% of the trial participants have been released. As of December 21, 2020, all 3 trials stopped enrollment of patients on ICU-level support when results showed that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation started in the ICU <a name="_Hlk67242973"></a><u>did not</u> reduce the need for organ support (OR = 0.76; 0.60, 0.97), and that there was potential harm. The analysis revealed with 98.5% probability that continuing the trial in ICU patients would be futile, and prespecified stopping rules were met. </p>

<p>Therapeutic-dose heparin or LMWH is not recommended for patients requiring ICU-level care at hospital admission who do not have other indications for therapeutic anticoagulation. Prophylactic doses of heparin or LMWH are still indicated.<sup>[3-10,16] </sup></p>

<p>At the time of publication, several trials in COVID-19 are assessing <a name="_Hlk67235049"></a>intermediate-dose versus standard prophylactic dose anticoagulation in the ICU (ie, IMPROVE, DAWn-Antico, and COVI-DOSE).<sup>[20-22] </sup>However, results from the INSPIRATION trial -- the first among these trials to be completed in March 2021-- did not demonstrate an advantage of intermediate-dose LMWH over standard-dose thromboprophylaxis for patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.<sup>[23]</sup> The INSPIRATION trial randomized 600 patients with COVID-19 from 10 Iranian ICUs to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg (intermediate dose) or enoxaparin 40 mg/kg (standard dose) for 30 days. In both groups, predefined modifications were advised according to body weight. The primary efficacy outcome, a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with ECMO, or all-cause mortality at 30 days, occurred in 45.7% (n = 126) of the intermediate-dose group and 44.1% (n = 126) of the standard-dose group (<em>P</em> = .70). All-cause mortality accounted for most of the composite outcome and was 43.1% in the intermediate-dose group and 40.9% in the standard-dose group.  Major bleeding defined using Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) criteria occurred in 2.5% of the intermediate-dose group and 1.4% of the standard dose group (<em>P</em> = .33). </p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in discharging this patient?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Give extended thromboprophylaxis regardless of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment </p>

<p>&#8226;	Use VTE and bleeding risk assessment to determine if extended thromboprophylaxis is appropriate</p>

<p>&#8226;	Do not continue thromboprophylaxis regardless of VTE risk assessment </p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Guidelines and guidance statements for COVID-related VTE prevention recommend against routine postdischarge prophylaxis but consider it reasonable for select COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding as determined by clinical gestalt or more formal risk assessment (eg, IMPROVEDD VTE risk score). </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Evidence-Based Discussion  </strong></p>

<p>The CORE-19 registry -- focused on post-discharge outcomes -- is the largest ongoing prospective study evaluating the rate of overall thromboembolic complications and all-cause mortality in the 90-days following a COVID-19-related hospitalization.<sup>[24]</sup> For a cohort of 4100 patients (mean age = 61 years) with complete data at the time of analysis, the registry showed an overall thromboembolic rate of 3.5%, a major bleeding rate of 1.6%, and a rehospitalization rate of 12.9% within 90 days. The all-cause mortality rate was 4.3%. These data suggest the need for a post-discharge thromboprophylaxis strategy, including assessing patients at risk for VTE.</p>

<p>A retrospective analysis compared post-discharge VTE rates between patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (n = 1877) and patients who had been hospitalized -- pre-pandemic -- for non-COVID-related medical illness (n = 18,159).<sup>[25]</sup> At 42 days post-discharge, the rate of hospital-associated VTE (HA-VTE) was 60% higher (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 0.77, 3.1) for the COVID-19 group. A total of 9 episodes occurred following COVID-19 hospitalization, corresponding with an HA-VTE rate of 4.8 per 1000 (0.5%) discharges. There were 56 episodes of HA-VTE in the medically ill group, corresponding with a post-discharge rate of 3.1 per 1000 (0.3%) discharges in the pre-COVID-19 era.</p>

<p>In the absence of COVID&#8208;19&#8208;specific data, guidelines and guidance statements for COVID-related VTE prevention recommend against anticoagulation beyond hospitalization unless the patient is high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding.<sup>[3,4,6-8,10] </sup>To assess risk, the CDC recommends using inclusion criteria from clinical trials studying post-discharge VTE prophylaxis in non-COVID medical illness.<sup>[8] </sup></p>

<p>Several VTE risk-assessment models (RAMs) have been externally validated and compared in their ability to assess VTE risk in medically ill patients.<sup>[26,27]</sup> Notably, these models are designed to evaluate VTE risk <em>during</em> hospitalization, not necessarily at hospital discharge. Among available RAMs, the IMPROVE VTE risk score<sup>[28]</sup> has undergone extensive external validation<sup>[27, 29-31] </sup>and uses 7 variables to stratify VTE risk.<strong> </strong>(Table 5.)<sup> </sup></p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>A&#160;patient&#160;who was&#160;hospitalized for&#160;COVID-19 is being discharged from the general ward.&#160;At the time of discharge, their&#160;IMPROVE&#160;VTE&#160;risk score is&#160;2&#160;and D-dimer is&#160;3&#160;x ULN.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Which of the following would be the most appropriate strategy for VTE prevention in this patient?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily</p>

<p>&#8226;	Enoxaparin 40 mg once daily</p>

<p>&#8226;	Rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Rivaroxaban and betrixaban are the only anticoagulants that have demonstrated clinical benefit in randomized trials and to have been FDA-approved for post-discharge extended VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients at high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding.<strong> </strong>In the absence of COVID&#8208;19&#8208;specific data, it is reasonable to consider either rivaroxaban or betrixaban in selected COVID&#8208;19 patients using the same risk/benefit criteria as in non-COVID settings. Betrixaban is largely unavailable, however.  </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>While VTE prevention trials are underway to investigate the use of anticoagulation following COVID-19 hospitalization,<sup> </sup>guidance has been drawn from previous studies in acute non-COVID-19 medical illness. Although there are differences between recommendations, most guidelines/guidance statements agree that postdischarge anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or betrixaban may be considered for patients with high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding.<sup>[3,8,10] </sup>The ACC and SCC-ISTH guidelines also include LMWH.<sup>[3,10]</sup><strong> </strong>(Table 6.)</p>

<p>*The MARINER trial included symptomatic VTE, while the other trials included both symptomatic VTE and asymptomatic VTE (protocol-based lower extremity Doppler).</p>

<p><sup>&#8224;</sup>Data for cohort 3 (overall population).</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>EXCLAIM (enoxaparin):</strong> The EXCLAIM trial compared-extended duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin (28 &#177; 4 days) to standard-duration enoxaparin (10 &#177; 4 days) in 5963 hospitalized patients with acute medical illness (eg, HF, respiratory disease, or infection) and &#8805; 3 days of immobility.<sup>[35] </sup>Although the rates of VTE were lower with extended-duration enoxaparin versus standard duration (2.5% vs 4.0%, respectively; <em>P</em> &lt; .04), this benefit was offset by a significant increase in major bleeding (0.8% vs 0.3%, respectively; <em>P</em> &lt; .05).<sup> </sup><em>(Note: Low VTE rates identified during interim data analysis prompted a major protocol amendment to the enrollment criteria while the study was ongoing).<sup> </sup></em></p>

<p><strong>ADOPT (apixaban):</strong> The ADOPT trial randomized 6528 hospitalized, medically ill patients to either extended-duration oral apixaban (30 days) or standard-duration enoxaparin (6 to 14 days) for VTE prevention.<sup>[40] </sup>A total of 4495 patients could be evaluated for the primary outcome based on adequate ultrasounds. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint in reducing risk for VTE or VTE-related death <a name="_Hlk64385982"></a>(0.87; 95% CI 0.62, 1.23; <em>P</em> = .44). The rate of major bleeding was 0.47% in the apixaban group and 0.19% in the enoxaparin group. The resulting 2.58-fold increased relative risk of major bleeding in the apixaban group was significant (2.58; 95% CI: 1.02, 7.24; <em>P</em> = .04).</p>

<p><strong>MAGELLAN (rivaroxaban):</strong> The MAGELLAN trial compared extended-duration rivaroxaban 10 mg daily (35 &#177; 4 days) with standard-duration enoxaparin (10 &#177; 4 days) for VTE prevention in 8101 hospitalized patients with medical illness.<sup>[36] </sup>The primary outcome -- a composite of <a name="_Hlk64446868"></a>asymptomatic proximal or symptomatic VTE -- was assessed at day 35. Rivaroxaban was shown to be superior to enoxaparin at day 35 (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.96; <em>P</em> = .02). However, benefits in VTE risk reduction were offset by major bleeding events, including an almost 3-fold increase in the risk of major bleeding (4.1% vs 1.7% with enoxaparin; <em>P</em> &lt; .001).</p>

<p><strong>APEX (betrixaban):</strong> The APEX trial randomized 7513 acutely ill hospitalized patients at risk for VTE to extended duration oral betrixaban 80 mg daily (35-42 days) or standard duration enoxaparin (6-14 days).<sup>[38] </sup>The study evaluated 3 progressively inclusive cohorts: patients with an elevated D-dimer level (cohort 1), patients with an elevated D-dimer level or age &#8805; 75 years (cohort 2), and all enrolled patients (cohort 3). The study used a sequential hierarchical analytic plan -- if analysis of any of the cohorts did not reach statistical significance, then the other analyses were considered exploratory. In cohort 1, betrixaban narrowly missed a significant reduction in risk for the study&#8217;s primary endpoint of asymptomatic proximal DVT or symptomatic VTE (RR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.65, 1.00; <em>P</em> = .054). As such, analyses of the other cohorts became exploratory, although results favored betrixaban in cohort 2 (RR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.66, 0.98; <em>P</em> = .03) and in cohort 3 (overall population) (RR: 0.76; 95% CI 0.63, 0.92; <em>P</em> = 0.006). In the overall population, there was no significant difference in major bleeding. Betrixaban is FDA approved for the prophylaxis of VTE in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE; however, betrixaban is not commercially available.<sup>[42] </sup></p>

<p><strong>MARINER (rivaroxaban):</strong> The MARINER trial was among the first to use the IMPROVEDD risk model to identify and evaluate post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk medical patients.<sup>[37]</sup> More than 12,000 patients (mean age = 69.7 years) were randomized to rivaroxaban 10 mg daily or placebo. Patients with the following 5 risk factors for major bleeding were excluded: active cancer at randomization, use of dual antiplatelet therapy at baseline, medical history of bronchiectasis or pulmonary cavitation, active</p>

<p>gastroduodenal ulcer, or any bleeding in the 3 months prior to randomization. The study drug was started at hospital discharge and continued for 45 days. The study failed to meet its primary endpoint -- reduction in VTE or VTE-related death -- but, there was a significant reduction in the secondary outcomes of symptomatic nonfatal VTE (HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.89) and symptomatic VTE or all-cause death (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.97). Notably, the trial had low symptomatic VTE event rates (number needed to treat [NNT] = 430). Major bleeding rates were low in both rivaroxaban and placebo groups, and not significantly different (0.28% vs. 0.15%, HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 0.84, 4.23). The number needed to harm (NNH) was 856. Despite using the IMPROVEDD criteria, the population was still generally a lower risk population than other extended VTE prophylaxis studies (ie, immobilized for 1 day vs 3 days, better renal function, lower mean age).<sup>[43] </sup></p>

<p><strong>MAGELLAN Subpopulation (rivaroxaban) </strong>In a post hoc analysis of the MAGELLAN trial, the 5 key risk factors for bleeding used to exclude patients in the MARINER trial were identified in approximately 20% of the MAGELLAN population: active cancer, dual antiplatelet therapy, bronchiectasis with pulmonary cavitation, gastroduodenal ulcer, or bleeding within the last 3 months.<sup>[39]</sup> By excluding data from 1551 patients with &#8805; 1 of these bleeding risk factors, the authors effectively identified a low-bleeding risk, high-VTE risk population. In the analysis of this subpopulation, rivaroxaban maintained efficacy in VTE risk reduction while major bleeding events were halved at day 10 (13 vs 24 events) and day 35 (22 vs 43 events) compared to the larger MAGELLAN study. Extended duration rivaroxaban significantly reduced the risk for VTE and VTE-related death by 32% (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.88, <em>P</em>&#8201;=&#8201;.003) compared to enoxaparin/placebo. The benefit-risk profile was improved in the subpopulation, with 182 events prevented (NNT = 55) and only 18 major bleeds caused (NNH = 560). This post hoc analysis led to rivaroxaban&#8217;s FDA approval for the prophylaxis of VTE during hospitalization and post hospital discharge in adult patients admitted for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE and not at high risk of bleeding.<sup>[44]</sup></p>

<p><strong><em>Summary of trials</em>:</strong> The MARINER trial excluded a high bleeding risk population that was discovered in hindsight in the MAGELLAN population and later excluded through post hoc analysis. Otherwise, inclusion and exclusion criteria were somewhat similar across these trials evaluating extended thromboprophylaxis. Patients were middle age or older and immobile for several days (although definitions of immobility varied). Patients were admitted for heart failure, cancer, acute ischemic stroke, infection or inflammatory disease, and respiratory insufficiency. An additional VTE risk factor was required in most circumstances. Currently, most patients hospitalized for COVID-19 meet the criteria of respiratory insufficiency, infection, and inflammation.</p>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> For what duration should the patient be advised to take the medication?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	6 to 14 days</p>

<p>&#8226;	21 to 28 days</p>

<p>&#8226;	31 to 39 days</p>

<p>&#8226;	40 to 45 days</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Rivaroxaban is indicated for VTE prevention in non-COVID-19 patients with medical illness, in hospital and after hospital discharge for a total duration of 31 to 39 days.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>The risk of experiencing VTE events remains high for hospitalized patients with medical illness for the first 30 days after hospital discharge.<sup>[45]</sup> Rivaroxaban is indicated for VTE prevention in patients hospitalized for a medical illness while in the hospital and after discharge, if VTE risk is high and bleeding risk is low.<sup>[44] </sup>The recommended total duration of treatment is 31 to 39 days. Betrixaban is also FDA-approved for extended VTE prophylaxis but is not commercially<sup> </sup>available. Although the trials that led to the approvals of rivaroxaban and betrixaban for post-discharge VTE prevention were conducted prior to the pandemic, COVID-19 guidelines and guidance statements recommend using the same trial inclusion and exclusion criteria to help refine decision making in the COVID-19 era.<sup>[3-8,10]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 1 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>All patients hospitalized in the ICU for COVID-19 should receive anticoagulation unless there are contraindications. For critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, standard dose thromboprophylaxis is recommended by most guidelines and guidance statements. Guidelines and guidance statements for COVID-related VTE prevention recommend against routine postdischarge prophylaxis but consider it reasonable for select COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for VTE and low risk for bleeding as determined by risk assessment. An ongoing NIH-sponsored trial, ACTIV 4c, is currently investigating if a DOAC can decrease the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic complications and death in patients discharged with COVID-19.<sup>[46]</sup> </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2: Adrian</strong></p>

<p>Adrian is a 52-year-old man brought to the hospital by his wife after 8 days at home with progressively worsening COVID-19 symptoms. &#8220;I kept telling him that he needed to go to the hospital, and he kept telling me he&#8217;d be fine,&#8221; his wife scorns. &#8220;He&#8217;s the love of my life, but I could strangle him. He could barely breathe and still refused to see a doctor!&#8221; </p>

<p>Examination revealed rales at Adrian&#8217;s lung bases and he was admitted to the general medical floor. Room air oxygen saturation is 90% and corrects with 3 liters of nasal canula oxygen. (Table 8.) </p>

<p><strong>Post-assessment Question Introduction:</strong> &#171; Production: only use this question introduction for the post-assessment version of this question &#187;</p>

<p>A 52-year-old&#160;male patient is&#160;admitted to&#160;the&#160;general medical floor&#160;after 8&#160;days of&#160;managing his&#160;COVID-19 symptoms&#160;at home.&#160;His&#160;weight and kidney function are normal.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Which VTE risk assessment tool is most appropriate to determine if this patient should receive thromboprophylaxis?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	IMPROVE score</p>

<p>&#8226;	Padua score</p>

<p>&#8226;	Caprini score</p>

<p>&#8226;	Risk assessment is not needed</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>Regardless of risk assessment score, all hospitalized adults with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, unless contraindicated or the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of thrombosis. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion </strong></p>

<p>Most guidelines and guidance statements recommend pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis for all hospitalized patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, in the absence of contraindications, regardless of their VTE risk assessment score.<sup>[3-10] </sup></p>

<p>Some guidelines/guidance statements support using VTE risk assessment tools to guide individualized intensification of anticoagulation, and refer to well-established tools such as the Caprini score, Padua score, and IMPROVE VTE score.<sup>[47-49]</sup> However, not to be confused, all patients admitted with COVID-19 are at increased risk of thrombosis.<sup>[13]</sup> Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 will benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis unless a contraindication exists wherein risk may outweigh the benefit (eg, active bleeding, profound thrombocytopenia).<sup>[3,5-10] </sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Continues</strong></p>

<p>Adrian is started on pharmacologic prophylaxis.</p>

<p><strong>Question 7: </strong>Based on interim analysis of unpublished data released by the NIH of 3 multiplatform trial results, which of the following is the most appropriate course of thromboprophylaxis for this patient?</p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Standard dose LMWH or UFH</p>

<p>&#8226;	Intermediate dose LMWH or UFH</p>

<p>&#8226;	Therapeutic dose LMWH or UFH</p>

<p>&#8226;	Prophylactic dose DOAC</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;: </strong>The body of evidence and guidance for addressing the coagulation derangements caused by COVID-19 is constantly evolving. For non-ICU patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the most current, although interim, results from REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a, and ATTACC showed that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was superior to standard-dose thromboprophylaxis in reducing the need for organ support in moderately ill, but not severely ill patients.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>Moderately ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 make up approximately 60% (n = 1772) of the total population enrolled in the REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a, and ATTACC multiplatform trials.<sup>[16] </sup>This subgroup of patients who did not receive ICU-level care or other organ support at trial enrollment were further stratified by high baseline D-dimer (&#8805; 2 x ULN) or low baseline D-dimer (&lt; 2 x ULN). At the time of writing, preliminary, non-peer reviewed, interim analysis of trial results including approximately 80% of the trial population have been released by the NIH. The interim primary outcome results for composite of days free from the need for organ support and in-hospital mortality -- are shown in Table 9.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;CAPTION&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>OR = odds ratio.</p>

<p>*An OR &gt; 1 represents benefit; a higher OR occurs when either mortality is improved and/or if those who survive have a reduced requirement for organ support.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;end table&gt;&gt;</strong></p>

<p>Therapeutic doses of LMWH or UFH, in addition to being safe, were superior to usual care (typically prophylactic doses of anticoagulants) in reducing the need for organ support in moderately ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, regardless of their baseline D-dimer level.<sup>[16] </sup>Thrombotic events and overall mortality rates -- both secondary outcomes -- were numerically lower with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation versus standard thromboprophylaxis.<sup> </sup>The mortality rates were 5.7% vs 7.7% in the therapeutic and standard dose groups, respectively. The rate of major bleeding with therapeutic dosing was 1.6% compared to 0.9% with standard dosing. Publication of the full results of this study are anticipated by early-to-mid 2021. </p>

<p>The use of DOACs as thromboprophylaxis for moderately ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is under investigation. Standard-dose rivaroxaban is being evaluated for reduction in all-cause mortality, ICU admission, and intubation in 650 planned participants in the ACOVACT and XACT trials.<sup>[50,51] </sup>DOACs including therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban and apixaban are being evaluated in the large randomized controlled trials, ACTION, COVID-PREVENT, FREEDOM COVID, XACT, and RAPID COVID COAG, which plan to enroll a total of more than 5200 participants.<sup>[51-55]</sup></p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Continues</strong></p>

<p>Adrian&#8217;s clinical status has improved, and while discussing his hospital discharge, his wife asks, &#8220;was there anything that we could have done differently? He&#8217;d been home for a week before agreeing to come here. If we&#8217;d come sooner, could he have stayed out of the hospital?&#8221; You tell her reassuringly, &#8220;the only thing we know for certain is that you gave your husband excellent care, and now he gets to go home to you.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> According to current guidelines/guidance statements, would thromboprophylaxis have been appropriate for this patient prior to his hospitalization?  </p>

<p><strong>Answer choices &#953;:</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Yes</p>

<p>&#8226;	No</p>

<p>&#8226;	I&#8217;m not sure</p>

<p><strong>Answer Explanation &#953;:</strong> Based on guidelines/guidance statements, thromboprophylaxis should not be initiated for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are being managed on an outpatient basis unless the patient is participating in a clinical trial.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 2&gt;&gt; Discussion</strong></p>

<p>In addition to increased risk for macrothrombosis, patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for immunomicrothrombotic complications, including pulmonary microvascular <em>thrombosis</em>. Autopsies from patients with COVID-19 demonstrate widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy and a 9-fold increase in alveolar-capillary microthrombi when compared to patients with influenza.<sup>[56]</sup> In addition to alveolar damage, platelet-fibrin thrombi are a common microscopic finding in the small pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients.<sup>[57-59] </sup>In this regard, immune-microthrombosis (not embolism) is likely responsible for some of the hypoxemia seen in COVID-19.<sup>[1,60]</sup></p>

<p>Currently, thromboprophylaxis is not recommended for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 managed as outpatients.<sup>[8]</sup> However, double-blind randomized, controlled trials are ongoing to investigate whether upstream therapies aimed at reducing the development of immunomicrothrombosis are efficacious and safe. The trials listed in Table 10 are currently enrolling patients. Notably, prevention of hospitalization is a primary outcome or component of the primary composite outcome in these trials. </p>

<p><strong>&lt;&lt;level 1&gt;&gt; Case 2 Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Hospitalized patients who are not severely ill with COVID-19 should receive therapeutic-dose heparin or LMWH, if they have acceptable bleeding risk, to decrease the need for ICU-level care -- not just to prevent VTE. This is a major shift in thinking for anticoagulation prophylaxis, which is not concentrated on traditional VTE, but is likely to prevent SARS-CoV-2 immune-microthrombosis. </p>
