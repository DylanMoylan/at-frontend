<p>1.	You are a member of the healthcare team seeing a 51-year-old woman receiving hemodialysis who is being considered for renal transplantation. She has questions about rejection of the allograft after surgery. What can you tell her?</p>

<p>A.	Approximately 7% of renal allografts are lost within 10 years</p>

<p>B.	The rate of renal allograft rejection has steadily declined over time</p>

<p>C.	Up to 30% of renal allograft biopsies demonstrate immune-related damage at 1 year after transplant</p>

<p>D.	She should receive surveillance renal biopsies every 1 to 2 years for the life of the allograft</p>

<p>Answer: About 35% of renal allograft recipients lose their transplanted kidney within 10 years. Moreover, these rates of long-term rejection of renal allografts are rising. Up to 30% of surveillance biopsies of renal allografts in the first year demonstrate early damage associated with immune function. However, routine surveillance biopsies are not practical as a tool to assess the risk for rejection over the long term of a renal allograft, and they lack discriminating power as to which transplants may fail in the long term.</p>

<p>2.	Which one of the following transitional-1 B cell (T1B cell) marker ratios was used to risk-stratify patients for renal transplant rejection in the current study by Cherukuri and colleagues?</p>

<p>A.	Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)/interleukin 12 (IL-12)</p>

<p>B.	IL-10/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#945;</p>

<p>C.	IL-6/interferon gamma</p>

<p>D.	TNF&#945;/GM-CSF</p>

<p>Answer: The current study finds that a T1B cell IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio of 1.3 or below predicts a high risk for T-cell-mediated rejection of renal allografts, whereas rejection is uncommon when the IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio exceeds 1.6.</p>

<a name="Heading332"></a><strong>Content</strong><strong> (approximately 1250 words)</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Clinical Context</strong></p>

<p>Although short-term results are positive for renal transplants, the authors of the current study note that about 35% of renal allograft recipients lose their transplanted kidney within 10 years. Moreover, these rates of long-term rejection of renal allografts are rising. </p>

<p>Subacute immunological damage is common among renal allografts. Up to 30% of surveillance biopsies of renal allografts in the first year demonstrate early damage associated with immune function. However, routine surveillance biopsies are not practical as a tool to assess the risk for rejection over the long term of a renal allograft, and they lack discriminating power as to which transplants may fail in the long term.</p>

<p>Regulatory B cells play an important role in immune function and potential allograft rejection, and the authors of the current study previously demonstrated that a lower ratio of interleukin 10 (IL-10) to tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#945;) produced by these cells was predictive of late renal allograft rejection. The current study furthers this research by applying the transitional-1 B cell IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio to 2 patient cohorts to assess its predictive value.</p>

<p><strong>Study Synopsis and Perspective</strong></p>

<p>A functional immunologic assay that could easily be incorporated into routine laboratory work can predict which patients are at high risk for rejection of their newly transplanted kidney early enough in the process that it would give physicians time to treat them and possibly prevent rejection, new research shows.</p>

<p>"People have been trying to find a biomarker that identifies rejection without having to do a biopsy," said senior author David Rothstein, MD, the Pittsburgh Steelers Chair in Transplantation and professor of surgery, medicine, and immunology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, told&#160;<em>Medscape Medical News</em>.</p>

<p>"Our biomarker allows us to predict rejection ahead of time, so this truly gives us a chance to preemptively increase immunosuppression and try and prevent damage before rejection occurs, because once the immune system is unleashed, it's a lot harder to control," he added.</p>

<p>"It's an exciting study, the culmination of years of work, and I think it will allow us to take steps towards personalized medicine in our field of transplantation," lead author Aravind Cherukuri, MD, also from the University of Pittsburgh, told&#160;<em>Medscape Medical News.</em>&#160;He noted that thus far, transplantation is behind other fields, such as oncology, with regard to personalized approaches to medicine.</p>

<p>"This biomarker could be used to guide surveillance biopsies and personalize immunosuppression in attempts to alter clinical course," Dr Cherukuri and coauthors write.</p>

<p>"I think studies like these and others taking a similar path will help us achieve this goal for transplantation," Dr Cherukuri added.</p>

<p>The study was published online in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>

<a name="Heading356"></a><a name="Heading357"></a><strong>IL-10 to TNF&#945; Ratio: Strong Predictor of Rejection Found in the Blood</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>About a third of patients lose their transplanted kidney within 10 years, and at that point, a new transplant is not easy. The patient's immune system is sensitized to the foreign organ, and it is harder to find a match.</p>

<p>A total of 244 kidney transplant recipients from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine participated in the study: 162 in the training set, and 82 in the internal validation set.</p>

<p>The investigators determined the ratio of IL-10 to tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#945;) produced by transitional-1 B cells (T1B cells) in peripheral blood 3 months after transplant.</p>

<p>Their main goal was to see whether that ratio could serve as an early predictor of T-cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) in the kidney transplant recipients. As the authors explain, B cells secrete IL-10 and TNF&#945;. The ratio of these 2 molecules is a measure of regulatory B-cell activity, which has been implicated in organ rejection.</p>

<p>Results showed that among patients with TCMR, the frequency of T1B cells was lower, as was the ratio of IL-10 to TNF&#945;&#160;in these cells at all points analyzed in comparison with patients in whom rejection did not occur (<em>P</em>&#160;&lt; .001).</p>

<p>The T1B IL-10 to TNF&#945; ratio at 3 months was the strongest predictor of rejection within the first year after transplant. In the training set, there was a 71% reduction in the risk of a patient's experiencing rejection with every unit increase in the T1B IL-10 to TNF&#945; ratio (<em>P</em>&#160;&lt; .001).</p>

<p>"At an optimal cutoff value of 1.3 for the ratio, sensitivity was 86%, specificity was 86%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 92%," the authors report. The positive predictive value (PPV) was also high, at 80%. The same ratio was predictive of subclinical T-cell-mediated rejection (scTCMR), with similarly high rates of sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV, the researchers add.</p>

<p>This is important, Dr Rothstein explained, inasmuch as 70% of late rejections are either subclinical or are clinically silent; the ability of the biomarker to identify patients who will experience kidney rejection later in their first posttransplant year is vital if that rejection is to be preemptively treated.</p>

<p>The biomarker also identified those with late TCMR with an average lead time of 8 months, which would give physicians enough time to increase immunosuppression preemptively to prevent scTCMR and more clinically obvious rejection episodes.</p>

<p>All results were validated in an internal validation set, which had a cutoff value of 1.3. The T1B IL-10 to TNF&#945; ratio predicted both early and late TCMR in the first year after transplant with similar accuracy.</p>

<p>Combining the 2 data sets, the researchers were able to identify 3 distinct risk groups: high risk, intermediate risk, and low risk. "In the high-risk group, 60% had early TCMR at the time of biomarker evaluation and, despite antirejection therapy, 48% developed recurrent or recalcitrant late TCMR," the investigators report.</p>

<p>Among high-risk patients for whom there was no evidence of early TCMR, almost three quarters subsequently developed late TCMR. "Overall, 58% of patients in the high-risk group had late rejection," they add.</p>

<p>Only 5% of patients in the low-risk group experienced early TCMR; another 5% had late TCMR.</p>

<p>"Thus, the T1B IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio identified not only patients with markedly high rates of early TCMR but also those with late TCMR," the investigators confirm.</p>

<a name="Heading386"></a><a name="Heading387"></a><strong>Independently Validated; Anti-TNF Therapy Dampens Down Effect</strong></h3>
<p></p>

<p>The same biomarker was further validated in a separate cohort of 95 kidney transplant recipients at the Royal Free Hospital in London, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>"Again, at an optimal cutoff value of 1.3 for the ratio, sensitivity was 75% and specificity was 92% for rejection anytime for the first year," Dr Rothstein said. Importantly, among high-risk patients in both cohorts, not only were rates of rejection increased, but there was a significant decrease in allograft survival at 5 years, which is "a hugely important point, because it means that even if physicians recognize and treat rejection, these kidneys fail," he said.</p>

<p>In high-risk patients, B cells are predominantly proinflammatory, the researchers explain.</p>

<p>They therefore examined the effect that anti-TNF&#945; therapy might have on this proinflammatory profile. In an in vitro study, they found that treatment with a TNF&#945; blocker desirably increased the IL-10 to TNF&#945; ratio and restored B-cell regulatory activity, which proved in concept that treatment of early rejection may restore B-cell regulatory activity for kidney transplant recipients and reduce their risk for rejection.</p>

<p>"The balance between IL-10 and TNF seems to indicate [what] your immune setpoint [is] -- is it going to be quiescent or is it going to be revved up and try to reject the transplant?" Dr Rothstein noted in a press release from his institution.</p>

<p>"We hope we can restore that balance with anti-TNF drugs," he added. The other piece of the puzzle that still needs to be worked out is whether the biomarker can be used sequentially, so that physicians will know whether they have successfully treated a high-risk patient and have reduced the risk for rejection.</p>

<p>This would allow them to track patients, and the investigators are planning to study this further.</p>

<p>"Right now, this biomarker can tell us that you are at high risk [for rejection], but hopefully it will be even more useful if it can be used to guide therapy and with successful immunosuppression [or other treatments], the patient's ratio will change so we can then say, now this patient is at low risk and we can stop any additional therapy," Dr Rothstein concluded.</p>

<p><strong>Study Highlights</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	Researchers completed a prospective observational study of nonselected renal transplant recipients at a large US academic health center. All patients had their transplant between 2013 and 2014. Once a cutoff value for rejection risk was derived, it was validated in a cohort of patients who receive renal transplant at 1 center in the United Kingdom between 2011 and 2014.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Researchers focused on the ratio of IL-10/TNF&#945; derived specifically from T1B lymphocytes at 3 months after transplant. Cryopreserved samples were tested for this ratio after cells were stimulated in vitro to produce inflammatory markers.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The main study outcome was graft loss. Researchers focused on the predictive value of IL-10/TNF&#945; in this outcome, using a cutoff of 1.3. Results were adjusted to account for age, sex, ethnicity, donor source, and multiple other variables that might affect allograft survival.</p>

<p>&#8226;	244 patients contributed to the derivation of the IL-10/TNF&#945; predictive tool, and 95 patients were included in the validation set. The T1B cell count was markedly lower among patients who developed TCMR. </p>

<p>&#8226;	Each unit increase in the IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio was associated with a 71% lower risk for TCMR. The optimal cutoff value of 1.3 was associated with sensitivity and specificity values of 86% and 86%, respectively, for TCMR in the first year after transplantation. These respective values in the validation cohort were 75% and 92%.</p>

<p>&#8226;	TCMR occurred at the following levels based on the IL-10/TNF&#945; ratios:</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#8226;	The negative predictive value of the ratio remained high in subgroup analyses based on age, sex, ethnicity, human leukocyte antigen mismatches, and other variables. Moreover, the IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio predictive results were not affected by infection with cytomegalovirus or BK virus.</p>

<p>&#8226;	High- and low-risk IL-10/TNF&#945; was also significantly associated with graft survival at 4 years after transplantation. </p>

<p>&#8226;	B-cell depletion was associated with increased TNF&#945; and lower IL-10, and treatment TNF&#945; antagonists led to higher IL-10/TNF&#945; ratios.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Implications</strong></p>

<p>&#8226;	About 35% of renal allograft recipients lose their transplanted kidney within 10 years. Moreover, these rates of long-term rejection of renal allografts are rising. Up to 30% of surveillance biopsies of renal allografts in the first year demonstrate early damage associated with immune function. However, routine surveillance biopsies are not practical as a tool to assess for the risk for rejection over the long term of a renal allograft, and they lack discriminating power as to which transplants may fail in the long term.</p>

<p>&#8226;	The current study finds that a T1B cell IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio of 1.3 or below predicts a high risk for TCMR of renal allografts, whereas rejection is uncommon when the ILL-10/TNF&#945; ratio exceeds 1.6.</p>

<p>&#8226;	Implications for the healthcare team: The healthcare team should consider the T1B IL-10/TNF&#945; ratio as a possible tool to predict the risk for TCMR among renal transplant patients. This risk stratification can help to plan patient care.</p>
